What is Algorithm?  
Why is the study of algorithms worthwhile?  
What is the role of algorithms relative to otehr technolgoies uesed in computers?  

**algorithm: any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values,
**input and **output
**Computational problem.

An algorithm is said to be correct: for every input instance, it hatls with the correct output. Also, correct algorithm solves the given computational problem.

##Algorithms as technology

Efficincy
insertion sort: tkaes time roughly equel to c1n^T2, 
merge sort: takes time roughly equl to c2n lg n

##Algorithms and other technologies

/**insertion sort: efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of element


initialization, maintanance, termination -> loop

Consider the searching problem:
Input: A sequence of n numbers A D ha1; a2;:::;ani and a value .
Output: An index i such that  D AÅ’i or the special value NIL if  does not
appear in A.
Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the sequence, looking
for . Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that
your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.

1. for i to a.length
2.  v = A[i]
3.  while i?0 and A[i] == value
4.   return i
5.return NIL

2.1.4
Consider the problem of adding two n-bit binary integers, stored in two n-element
arrays A and B. The sum of the two integers should be stored in binary form in

an .n C 1/-element array C. State the problem formally and write pseudocode for
adding the two integers.
